## Frontend Dev assignment

### `How to run`

    git clone https://github.com/foxxxyproxy/loan-calculator.git
    cd loan-calculator
    yarn install
    yarn start

It runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser <br>

### TODO
There is still a big room for improvement like adding more tests, split components into smaller ones <br>
I've checked the app for modern browsers, but because of styled-sliders it should be checked (and fixed) for IE <br>
